Welcome to troll.sh. This website acts as a collection of shell based pranks to
play on your "friends". To use it just run the code below when someone slips up
and leaves themselves logged into a computer:

{% highlight bash %}
curl -L troll.sh | bash
{% endhighlight %}

If you have your own prank you want to add or notice a bug, you can send a pull
request to the [github repo](http://github.com/jmatth/troll.sh).
